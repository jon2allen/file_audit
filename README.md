# file_audit
Simple c++ tool to search for files by extension and write to csv file. 
# Notes
Used chatGPT  to create most of the code via Bing chat.

* Main module file_audit.cpp
* progress.h class

I glued pieces together.

- added part to count all files in dir structure
- updated progress bar
- extra prints

for details. took a few iterations to get it right.

Licsnes is MIT.  Not sure about it.  The code looks like many of the examples out on the internet.
